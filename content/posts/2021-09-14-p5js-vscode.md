# Setting up Visual Studio Code for p5js

I have always been a great fan of [Processing](https://processing.org/de/), the Java-based language for creative coding. While I do like programming in `Python` or `c++` much more than `Java`, it is just nice to open the IDE of `processing` and start getting creative without setting up complicated frameworks. [p5js](https://p5js.org/) is like *Processing* but based on *Javascript*, and so the *sketches* can be easily shared without other external dependencies.

There is a powerful [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) for *p5js* on the homepage of the project, but I am a fan of  coding in *VS Code* set up exactly the way I like it. Here I describe how to set up *VS Code* for *p5js*. 

**Remark** I know that there exist some all-in-one extensions for *p5js* but for now, I stick to my slightly more *complex* way.

## 1. Setting up the framework

Create a new directory for the sketch. We then need three files as a minimal boilerplate. The minimal `index.html` page just loads the library and the actual *sketch*.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>SKETCH NAME</title>
    <style> body {padding: 0; margin: 0;} </style>
    <script src="p5.min.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

```

I like to link to a local copy of the library ([Download](https://p5js.org/download/)), but you can also refer to the [CDN hosted version](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js).

Finally, `sketch.js` is where the magic happens ;). A minimal template may look like this:
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

## 2. Setting up VS Code

While VS Code is perfectly fine for programming in *p5js* (after all it is *Javascript* and you can open the `index.html` simply in your browser), I do recommend getting two extensions.

1. [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) opens the sketch in your favorite browser (just press `Go Live` in the status bar).
2. The [p5js Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acidic9.p5js-snippets) extension (by the fantastic [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/)) may save you time when coding in *p5js*.
