Today i post only the solution to [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4). Not nice nor efficient, had one nasty bug so the solution to part 1 as correct, but not the second part. But after four days, i'm still on track. The only *highlight* of today is the usage of a ```shortcode``` to include the code file into this post.

**Update**: This code is really ugly ;).

$$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx$$
