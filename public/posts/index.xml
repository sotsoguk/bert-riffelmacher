      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get back to coding and problem solving at the moment and came across Advent Of Code, which seems to be a very good project to help me get started and keep me motivated. I will try to solve the problems using python, and maybe c++ or any other language if i have the time.
Day 1: Chronal Calibration Part 1 The first part of the first problem was a very good starter for me.</description>
